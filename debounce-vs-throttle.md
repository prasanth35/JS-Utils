#### Debounce:

```
Debouncing ensures that a function is executed only after a certain period of inactivity or delay since the last event.
It's commonly used when you want to delay or defer a function's execution until the user has stopped interacting with an input or when you want to prevent a function from being called too frequently during rapid, continuous events.
```
##### Use Cases:
- Handling user input, such as search suggestions or filtering as the user types.
- Delaying AJAX requests when a user is typing in a search box to avoid sending too many requests.
- Resizing elements on a web page only after the user has finished resizing the window.

#### Throttle:

```
Throttling limits the rate at which a function can be executed, ensuring it is not called more frequently than a specified time interval.
It's commonly used when you want to ensure that a function is called at a controlled and steady rate, such as for performance optimization or managing the frequency of specific actions.
```
##### Use Cases:
- Limiting the rate of scroll event handling to improve performance, e.g., for parallax effects.
- Preventing button double-clicks by throttling the click event to avoid accidental double submissions.
- Controlling how often a function can be called in response to continuous mouse movement.

```
In summary, debounce is used to delay the execution of a function until a pause in events, while throttle is used to limit the rate of function execution during a continuous stream of events. The choice between debounce and throttle depends on the specific requirements of your application and the desired behavior for handling events.
